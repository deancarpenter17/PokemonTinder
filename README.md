# PokemonTinder
PokemonTinder is an Android app in which users create an account by choosing their favorite Pokemon to represent them and 
either swipe left or right on the other Pokemon based on interest! When two users both swipe right on each other, they then
become a match. Matches are able to then message each other via the hamburger menu.
## Installation
Due to copyright issues, this app is not available on the Google Play Store.
## Usage

(Each Pokemons moves are randomly generated everytime you search. These moves are pulled from a list of their of available 
moves.) Finally, press the "Find Matches" button to search for other Pokemon in the database! Swipe left or press the "X"
button to dislike a Pokemon. Swipe right or press the "Heart" button to like a Pokemon. To view your matches & messages, press
