# PokemonTinder
PokemonTinder is an Android app in which users create an account by choosing their favorite Pokemon to represent them and 
either swipe left or right on the other Pokemon based on interest! When two users both swipe right on each other, they then
become a match. Matches are able to then message each other via the hamburger menu.
## Installation
Due to copyright issues, this app is not available on the Google Play Store.
## Usage
1. Press the "Create Account Button". You must log in with your Google account.
